Get Started With Okta
=========================

Okay, so you've been using Stormpath for a while and now you want to check out out Okta. This guide will walk you through
setting up a new account, creating an API token, and everything else you'll need to get up and running on Okta.

Create an Okta Developer Account
--------------------------------

1. Head on over to: https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/
2. Fill out the signup form, and click "Get Started"
3. Within a few minutes you will get a confirmation email, follow the instructions in the email to finish setting up your account


Your Okta URLs
--------------

When setting up a developer account, you'll end up with a couple URLs. The first is an admin console URL that looks something like this: 

https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/getting-started

Use this one to manually change organization settings, create users, or other general administrative work.  

The other URL looks similar, but is missing the `admin` section: 

https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com/

This is the URL your users will interact with, and it will be the base URL for any API access.

**Important:** The second URL (the non-admin one) is the one you will need to remember. You will use this URL for API access.
 
Set Up your Okta 'Organization'
------------------------------

### Create an Application

1. Navigate to your Admin console: i.e. https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/dashboard
2. On the top menu click 'Applications'
3. Click 'Add Application' 
4. Click 'Create New App'
5. On the 'Create a New Application Integration' pop-up, select the following values then click 'Create':
  - Platform - Native
  - Sign-on Method - OpenID Connect
6. On the 'Create OpenID Connect Integration' page, enter the following values and click 'Next'
  - Application Name - 'My Test Application'
7. Use `http://localhost:8080/client/callback` for the Redirect URI's, and click 'Finish'

Your application has been created, but you still have a few settings to change: 

1. On the 'General' tab, click 'Edit' on the 'General Settings' panel
2. Select the 'Refresh Token', and 'Resource Owner Password' checkboxes and click 'Save'
3. Click the 'Edit' button on the 'Client Credentials' panel
4. Select the 'Use Client Authentication' radio button, and click 'Save'
5. Click on the 'Groups' tab
6. Select the 'Assign' button in the 'Everyone' column, and click 'Done'
7. Grab the ID portion of the URL of your browser's current page, for example: if your URL was: `https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/app/oidc_client/instance/00icu81200icu812/#tab-groups` then `00icu81200icu812` would be your application's ID

**Important:** You will need to remember your application's ID.

### Create an Access Token

1. Navigate to your Admin console: i.e. https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/dashboard
2. On the top menu click on 'Security' -> 'API'
3. Select the 'Tokens' tab
4. Click 'Create Token'
5. On the pop-up, give your new token a name, for example: 'My Test Token', and click 'Create Token'

**Important:** You will need to remember this token value, so copy/paste it somewhere safe.

For more information take a look at the official [Create an API token](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html) guide.


Run an Example Application
--------------------------

Since you're reading this page on Github, I'll assume you know how to clone this repo, and switch to the `okta` branch. Once you've done that, build the current SNAPSHOT with Apache Maven.

``` bash
$ mvn clean install
```

This shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Once complete, change directories to examples/spring-boot-default. (The Spring and Servlet examples work too!)

``` bash
$ cd examples/spring-boot-default
```

The last step before running the example is to set your configuration variables. There are a [few different ways](https://docs.stormpath.com/java/servlet-plugin/config.html) you can do this; we'll use environment variables here.

``` bash
$ export STORMPATH_CLIENT_BASEURL=[baseurl_from_above]
$ export OKTA_APPLICATION_ID=[application_id_from_above]
$ export OKTA_API_TOKEN=[api_token_from_above]
```

Now, start it up...

``` bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Point your browser to: http://localhost:8080 and you're ready to start using the example application!


## Additional Configuration

| Property | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| stormpath.registration.workflow.enabled | Require email verification before logging in | false |
| stormpath.email.hostname | Email Server Hostname | localhost |
| stormpath.email.port | Email Server Port | 25 |
| stormpath.email.sslEnabled | SSL enabled | false |
| stormpath.email.sslCheckServerIdentityEnabled | SSL Verify Server Identity  | false |
| stormpath.email.tlsEnabled | TLS Enabled | false |
| stormpath.email.username | Email Username | n/a |
| stormpath.email.password | Email Password | n/a |
| stormpath.email.verifyEmailTemplate | JSON file from Stormpath Export used for email verification | /com/stormpath/sdk/mail/templates/verifyEmail.json |
| stormpath.email.forgotPasswordTemplate | SON file from Stormpath Export used for forgot password/reset | /com/stormpath/sdk/mail/templates/forgotPassword.json |
| stormpath.application.allowApiClientCredentials | See notes about client credentials below | false |

### Email Configuration

These integrations use [Apache Commons Email](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/userguide.html) to send email verification and forgot password/reset emails.

**NOTE:** These workflows require a mail server.

Gmail can be configured with the following settings (generate an [App-Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)):

```
-Dstormpath.email.hostname=smtp.gmail.com
-Dstormpath.email.port=587
-Dstormpath.email.tlsEnabled=true
-Dstormpath.email.username=<email@address>
-Dstormpath.email.password=<app-password>
```

Email template json files can be found in the `emailTemplates` folder of your Stormpath data export. Just include them on the classpath of your application.


### Required Okta Configuration Change

In order for email verification and password reset workflows to work, you will need add additional properties to Okta user profile.

1. Log into your Okta Admin Console
2. Select 'Directory' from the top menu, then select 'Profile Editor'
3. Click 'Profile' on the top entry in the table for 'User'
4. For each item in the table, create new Attributes:

  | Display name | Variable name |
  |--------------|---------------|
  | Email Verification Status | emailVerificationStatus |
  | Email Verification Token | emailVerificationToken |
  | Stormpath Migration Recovery Answer | stormpathMigrationRecoveryAnswer |
  
5. Click 'Add Attribute'
6. Enter the 'Display name' and 'Variable name' from above
7. Click 'Save' or 'Save and Add Another' when you're finished.

**NOTE:** The Stormpath -> Okta import process will create these fields for you, but the `emailVerificationToken` attribute size will be too small. You can edit this attribute and either remove the min/max attribute length, or set the max to 10000.

### Client Credentials

Client credentials are supported by storing a plain text version of your client credential id:secret in user profile data (similar to Stormpath's Custom Data). To use this feature you MUST enable it via the 
`stormpath.application.allowApiClientCredentials=true` property. NOTE: the validation of the id and secret is done via the integration and there will be no audit log on Okta's server of these logins. Use this feature while migrating only. Alternatively, you can create an Okta Application and use it's client id/secret, or create 'service user' accounts and use basic authentication.
